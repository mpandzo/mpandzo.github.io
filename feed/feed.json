      "title": "The power of laziness",
      "content_html": "<p>I hate repetitive work. Read, copy, paste, edit, repeat. It's horribly monotonous and I always make a mistake that I have to go back and fix.</p>\n<p>As a friend of mine quipped once, perhaps humans invent stuff out of laziness? Some lazy bastard didn't want to walk so they invented the wheel. What's the remote control if not the quintessence of laziness - it's there because someone couldn't be bothered to get up and change the channel. The same goes for escalators, cars, telephones etc.</p>\n<p>All jesting aside, laziness of this kind is not for a lack of energy or care, it's about wanting to find easier, more efficient ways to accomplish something. And the art of programming is all about this exact practice. Finding solutions that will make the computer do the grunt work for you.</p>\n<p>I recently needed to convert an array of strings into an array of JSON objects. Along the way, I also needed to slugify the string and get rid of accents/diacritics - you know, convert letters like í,á,ü into i,a,u.</p>\n<p>My original array looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code>const teamsLaLiga = [\n  &quot;Almería&quot;,\n  &quot;Athletic Bilbao&quot;,\n  &quot;Atlético Madrid&quot;,\n  &quot;Barcelona&quot;,\n  &quot;Cádiz&quot;,\n  &quot;Celta Vigo&quot;,\n  &quot;Elche&quot;,\n  &quot;Espanyol&quot;,\n  &quot;Getafe&quot;,\n  &quot;Girona&quot;,\n  &quot;Mallorca&quot;,\n  &quot;Osasuna&quot;,\n  &quot;Rayo Vallecano&quot;,\n  &quot;Real Betis&quot;,\n  &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,\n  &quot;Real Sociedad&quot;,\n  &quot;Sevilla&quot;,\n  &quot;Valencia&quot;,\n  &quot;Valladolid&quot;,\n  &quot;Villarreal&quot;,\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the <code>á</code> and <code>é</code> in Cádiz and Atlético Madrid.</p>\n<p>I wanted to achieve JSON in the form of:</p>\n<pre><code>const jsonTeams = [\n  ...\n  {\n    name: 'Atletico Madrid',\n    displayName: 'Atlético Madrid',\n    slug: 'atletico-madrid'\n    league: 'la-liga',\n  },\n  ...\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, sure, this was a fairly small array, and I could have done the work manually, however, I wanted to do the same with Turkish Süper Lig team names like &quot;Fatih Karagümrük&quot; and &quot;İstanbul Başakşehir&quot;, and Portuguese Primeira liga team names like &quot;Marítimo&quot; and &quot;Paços de Ferreira&quot;. There'd be a lot of manual work involved.</p>\n<p>So, instead of manually copying, pasting and editing things for an hour, I quickly wrote a script to do the work for me. To get rid of accents/diacritics I used the lodash library's <a rel=\"bookmark nofollow\" href=\"https://docs-lodash.com/v4/deburr/\">deburr</a> method. To slugify titles I used the <a rel=\"bookmark nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/slugify\">slugify</a> library. Both were added to my simple script as script references via <a rel=\"bookmark nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/\">cdn.jsdelivr.net</a>.</p>\n<p>The html to achieve this looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slugify@1.6.5/slugify.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash.deburr@4.1.0/index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n  (() =&gt; {\n    const teamsLaLiga = [\n      &quot;Almería&quot;,\n      &quot;Athletic Bilbao&quot;,\n      &quot;Atlético Madrid&quot;,\n      &quot;Barcelona&quot;,\n      &quot;Cádiz&quot;,\n      &quot;Celta Vigo&quot;,\n      &quot;Elche&quot;,\n      &quot;Espanyol&quot;,\n      &quot;Getafe&quot;,\n      &quot;Girona&quot;,\n      &quot;Mallorca&quot;,\n      &quot;Osasuna&quot;,\n      &quot;Rayo Vallecano&quot;,\n      &quot;Real Betis&quot;,\n      &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,\n      &quot;Real Sociedad&quot;,\n      &quot;Sevilla&quot;,\n      &quot;Valencia&quot;,\n      &quot;Valladolid&quot;,\n      &quot;Villarreal&quot;,\n    ];\n\n    const jsonTeams = [];\n    teamsLaLiga.forEach((teamName) =&gt; {\n      jsonTeams.push({\n        name: deburr(teamName),\n        slug: slugify(teamName, { lower: true, remove: /[*+~.()'&quot;!:@]/g }),\n        displayName: teamName,\n        league: &quot;la-liga&quot;\n      });\n    });\n\n    console.log(jsonTeams);\n  })();\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: the call to <code>slugify(teamName, { lower: true, remove: /[*+~.()'&quot;!:@]/g })</code> includes the remove option that takes a Regex expression to get rid of characters '*+~.()'&quot;!:@' when creating the slugs.</p>\n<p>The script above resulted in a JSON array formatted exactly as I wanted it:</p>\n<pre><code>[{\n  displayName: &quot;Almería&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Almeria&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;almeria&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Athletic Bilbao&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Athletic Bilbao&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;athletic-bilbao&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Atlético Madrid&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Atletico Madrid&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;atletico-madrid&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Barcelona&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Barcelona&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;barcelona&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Cádiz&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Cadiz&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;cadiz&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Celta Vigo&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Celta Vigo&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;celta-vigo&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Elche&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Elche&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;elche&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Espanyol&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Espanyol&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;espanyol&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Getafe&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Getafe&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;getafe&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Girona&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Girona&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;girona&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Mallorca&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Mallorca&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;mallorca&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Osasuna&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Osasuna&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;osasuna&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Rayo Vallecano&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Rayo Vallecano&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;rayo-vallecano&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Real Betis&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Real Betis&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;real-betis&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Real Madrid&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;real-madrid&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Real Sociedad&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Real Sociedad&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;real-sociedad&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Sevilla&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Sevilla&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;sevilla&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Valencia&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Valencia&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;valencia&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Valladolid&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Valladolid&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;valladolid&quot;\n}, {\n  displayName: &quot;Villarreal&quot;,\n  league: &quot;la-liga&quot;,\n  name: &quot;Villarreal&quot;,\n  slug: &quot;villarreal&quot;\n}]\n</code></pre>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I've been playing around with <a href=\"https://sst.dev/\">SST</a> over the last few days. SST is a &quot;framework that makes it easy to build serverless apps&quot;. It builds on top of the AWS CDK (Amazon's cloud development kit) and comes with a set of impressive features including a live lambda dev environment, a management dashboard, debugging with breakpoints in VS Code as well as out-of-the-box support for JS and TS (using esbuild), Go, Python, C#, and F#.</p>\n<p>SST is infrastructure-as-code on steroids. It comes with higher-level constructs designed specifically for serverless apps resulting in code that looks mighty impressive:</p>\n<pre><code>import * as sst from '@serverless-stack/resources';\n\nimport { StorageStack } from './StorageStack';\nimport { ApiStack } from './ApiStack';\nimport { AuthStack } from './AuthStack';\nimport { WebStack } from './WebStack';\nimport { CronStack } from './CronStack';\n\nexport default function main(app: sst.App): void {\n  // Set default runtime for all functions\n  app.setDefaultFunctionProps({\n    runtime: 'nodejs16.x',\n    srcPath: 'services',\n    bundle: {\n      format: 'esm',\n    },\n  });\n\n  app\n    .stack(StorageStack).stack(ApiStack).stack(AuthStack).stack(CronStack).stack(WebStack);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-&quot;boolean&quot;-from-another-module-or-realm.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cannot use GraphQLScalarType &quot;Boolean&quot; from another module or realm. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://mirzapandzo.com/posts/sst-cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-boolean-from-another-module-or-realm/#cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-%22boolean%22-from-another-module-or-realm.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But I digress. While learning and ins-and-outs of the framework (I am nowhere near done), I used the <code>create sst</code> command to set up an app and followed the SST guide to add different stack constructs. I chose Vue.js for my web stack and managed to query the GraphQL endpoint without issue. I was playing with the Cron construct when I suddenly noticed the following error in my console:</p>\n<pre><code>Failed to extract schema from pothos\nError: Cannot use GraphQLScalarType &quot;Boolean&quot; from another module or realm.\n\nEnsure that there is only one instance of &quot;graphql&quot; in the node_modules\ndirectory.

I was commenting things left, right and center but the error would not go away.</p>\n<p>Dax from the [SST discord] (<a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/983865673656705025/985224097342582865/997233904698277898\">https://discord.com/channels/983865673656705025/985224097342582865/997233904698277898</a>) mentioned this might be a node_modules conflict when asked about the issue a few days ago, however, I was intrigued why this problem was suddenly occurring for me when I was able to run GraphQL without issue only a few moments ago.</p>\n<p>Then it struck me! SST is configured with workspaces to hoist modules into the root node_modules folder. I had used yarn to install sst initially, but, while playing around with the Cron construct I went and used npm to install rss-parser (force of habit). As a result, this mixing of yarn and npm commands caused a conflict within my node_modules resulting in the above errors</p>\n<p>To fix the issue, I removed all node_modules folders with <code>rm -Rf node_modules</code> and used yarn to install. I was able to continue working and the conflict was resolved.</p>\n<p>Note: If this fix does not work for you, you may have to resort to adding a resolutions section to your graphql folder's package.json file as follows to force the use of the correct graphql library.</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;resolutions&quot;: {\n  &quot;graphql&quot;: &quot;16.5.0&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
