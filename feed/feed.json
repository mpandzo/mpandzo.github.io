      "content_html": "<p>I've been playing around with <a href=\"https://sst.dev/\">SST</a> over the last few days. SST is a &quot;framework that makes it easy to build serverless apps&quot;. It builds on top of the AWS CDK (Amazon's cloud development kit) and comes with a set of impressive features including a live lambda dev environment, a management dashboard, debugging with breakpoints in VS Code as well as out-of-the-box support for JS and TS (using esbuild), Go, Python, C#, and F#.</p>\n<p>SST is infrastructure-as-code on steroids. It comes with higher-level constructs designed specifically for serverless apps resulting in code that looks mighty impressive:</p>\n<pre><code>import * as sst from '@serverless-stack/resources';\n\nimport { StorageStack } from './StorageStack';\nimport { ApiStack } from './ApiStack';\nimport { AuthStack } from './AuthStack';\nimport { WebStack } from './WebStack';\nimport { CronStack } from './CronStack';\n\nexport default function main(app: sst.App): void {\n  // Set default runtime for all functions\n  app.setDefaultFunctionProps({\n    runtime: 'nodejs16.x',\n    srcPath: 'services',\n    bundle: {\n      format: 'esm',\n    },\n  });\n\n  app\n    .stack(StorageStack).stack(ApiStack).stack(AuthStack).stack(CronStack).stack(WebStack);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-&quot;boolean&quot;-from-another-module-or-realm.\" tabindex=\"-1\">Cannot use GraphQLScalarType &quot;Boolean&quot; from another module or realm. <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://mirzapandzo.com/posts/sst-cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-boolean-from-another-module-or-realm/#cannot-use-graphqlscalartype-%22boolean%22-from-another-module-or-realm.\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>But I digress. While learning and ins-and-outs of the framework (I am nowhere near done), I used the <code>create sst</code> command to set up an app and followed the SST guide to add different stack constructs. I chose Vue.js for my web stack and managed to query the GraphQL endpoint without issue. I was playing with the Cron construct when I suddenly noticed the following error in my console:</p>\n<pre><code>Failed to extract schema from pothos\nError: Cannot use GraphQLScalarType &quot;Boolean&quot; from another module or realm.\n\nEnsure that there is only one instance of &quot;graphql&quot; in the node_modules\ndirectory.

I was commenting things left, right and center but the error would not go away.</p>\n<p>Dax from the [SST discord] (<a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/983865673656705025/985224097342582865/997233904698277898\">https://discord.com/channels/983865673656705025/985224097342582865/997233904698277898</a>) mentioned this might be a node_modules conflict when asked about the issue a few days ago, however, I was intrigued why this problem was suddenly occurring for me when I was able to run GraphQL without issue only a few moments ago.</p>\n<p>Then it struck me! SST is configured with workspaces to hoist modules into the root node_modules folder. I had used yarn to install sst initially, but, while playing around with the Cron construct I went and used npm to install rss-parser (force of habit). As a result, this mixing of yarn and npm commands caused a conflict within my node_modules resulting in the above errors</p>\n<p>To fix the issue, I removed all node_modules folders with <code>rm -Rf node_modules</code> and used yarn to install. I was able to continue working and the conflict was resolved.</p>\n",
